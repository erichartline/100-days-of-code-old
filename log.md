# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 22: 1/25/2017

**Today's Progress** I worked through some of freeCodeCamp's beta curriculum.

**Thoughts** Currently going through the Applied Visual Design track. Great stuff so far! Have only found a handful of bugs/typos, and plan on fixing some of them for FCC tomorrow.

### Day 21: 1/24/2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on Chingu Challenge 1 on HackerRank.

**Thoughts** I sent in two successful submissions, but for some reason I cannot get the "multiples of 3 and 5" challenge to pass. I'm getting the correct answer for two of the three test cases, and all of them work when I run the script outside of HackerRank, so I'm not sure why it's not officially passing. Will sleep on it and try to figure it out tomorrow. Was a good session at least!

### Day 20: 1/23/2017

**Today's Progress** I worked through some of freeCodeCamp's beta curriculum.

**Thoughts** It was a long day, so I decided to unwind by working through some of FCC's new challenges. I'm loving the new material, but there are definitely some bugs to fix. I sent in a request to see the best way of fixing some minor issues (such as a handful of typos I've found). Really excited to help out, even if they are just small items.

### Day 19: 1/22/2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on my pomodoro clock project.

**Thoughts** Struggling a bit with getting my JavaScript timers to work properly. My code is a bit of a mess right now, but I feel like I am getting there. Currently 17/26 of the test cases passing.

### Day 18: 1/21/2017

**Today's Progress** I finished the Caesars Cipher challenge in Problem Set 2 of CS50. I also spent a few hours working on my pomodoro clock project.

**Thoughts** I noticed that Free Code Camp released the beta version of their new curriculum today, and I immediately got excited. I really like that the projects now have their own built-in test cases, and they require each of them to pass before you can move on. I saw that they are looking for QA testing on the pomodoro clock challenge, so I reworked my current version to match their criteria. Currently I am passing 15/26 of the tests, and I'm feeling a bit optimistic that I could finish it within the next week. Of course, that would mean having to do that instead of CS50. I have been going back and forth on that... I'm already feeling the benefits of CS50, but I also really want to get my front end certification before FCC switches over. Right now I'm leaning toward just doing that, especially since I am loving the clock project.

### Day 17: 1/20/2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on Problem Set 2 of CS50.

**Thoughts** Nearly done with Caear's Cipher, will be finishing tomorrow.

### Day 16: 1/19/2017

**Today's Progress** I spent a good hour playing around with Git.

**Thoughts** I intended to work more on my CS50 assignments but got sidetracked with Git and GitHub. I was tired of not getting credit for my commits in this repo, so I cloned my old fork and started a new one. Silly, maybe, but it did help me get familiar with some other commands besides the same four I use everyday.

### Day 15: 1/18/2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on Problem Set 2 of CS50.

**Thoughts** I finished `initials.c` and started the Caesars Cipher challenge. After spending so much time coding in JavaScript the last few days, it took me a minute to get back into C. Feeling more optimistic now though, and looking forward to finishing this challenge tomorrow.

### Day 14: 1/17/2017

**Today's Progress** I watched CS50's Week 2 lecture and completed a handful of Codewars katas.

**Thoughts** While I am eager to continue working on my pomodoro clock, I also want to stay focused on CS50. I watched this week's lecture (nearly two hours again) and took a peek at the new problem sets. They don't look too bad this week -- one of them is a variation of Caesar's Cipher, which I have already built in JavaScript for FCC. I'll most likely continue working on CS50 first this week, then plan on another marathon coding session on Saturday for my clock project.

### Day 13: 1/16/2017

**Today's Progress** I finished my calculator (!), then I immediately started working on my next project: the pomodoro clock.

**Thoughts** I skipped yesterday because it was my wife's birthday, and we were busy celebrating all day. I made up for it today by coding for several hours, however. After cleaning up some noticeable bugs in my calculator (like banning multiple decimals), I decided to push out the end product as my final version. Someday I would like to add working keyboard input, but for now I really want to keep on trucking through the FCC curriculum. I started my pomodoro clock immediately after submitting the calculator, and I feel like I have already made some decent progress. Getting the timer to work properly seems like it might be tricky, but I am looking forward to the challenge!

### Day 12: 1/14/2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on my calculator.

**Thoughts** I made some major progress today, though I really wanted to get this all the way done. I decided to upgrade my calculator so it would have two lines: one for current input, and one below it that would show the full equation. This proved a little more difficult than anticipated, but I was finally able to get it working the way I wanted. The only problem is that I still have several bugs on my "to-fix" list on Trello, and none of them appear to be exactly easy fixes. That's OK though because once I have this up to snuff, I will be very proud of the end result.

### Day 11: 1/13/2017

**Today's Progress** Today I went to my first Free Code Camp meetup!

**Thoughts** The meetup was a really cool experience. While we didn't get a ton of coding done, we did have some great web dev-related discussions, and I helped a fellow camper with a challenge she was stuck on. I am definitely interested in going to more of these in the near future, and it sounds like the community is gaining more traction in my city.

### Day 10: 1/12/2017

**Today's Progress** I finished Problem Set 1 of CS50.

**Thoughts** My Mario solution from yesterday had a small bug (one too many spaces on each line), but I was able to fix that fairly quickly. From there, I also finished the fourth problem ("Greedy") and completed the "advanced" version of the Mario problem. Tomorrow I'll be going to my first Free Code Camp meetup!

**Thoughts** Time was limited again so I just continued working on this week's CS50 problems. Nearly done with them.

### Day 8: 1/10/2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on Problem Set 1 of CS50.

**Thoughts** After breezing through the first couple problems, I hit a roadblock with the Mario pyramid. I have a good idea of how to solve this in JavaScript, but I'm having problems implementing it properly in C. Couldn't do more than the hour today, so back at it again tomorrow...

### Day 7: 1/9/2017

**Today's Progress** I started Week 1 of CS50.

**Thoughts** After a looooong video lecture (over two hours long!), I started working on this week's problem sets using C. First impressions: C reminds me a lot of JavaScript, though definitely a bit more "finicky" (i.e. requiring the use of includes at the top of the script, and also no hoisting (?)). I'm looking forward to diving deeper into the language though.

### Day 6: 1/8/2017

**Today's Progress** I made *amazing* progress on my calculator this weekend.

**Thoughts** I would say I'm 85-90% finished. I gave it a complete redesign today, and I'm pretty happy with how it looks now. I also fixed a bunch of bugs, most importantly making it so you can't hit two operators in a row. I'm hoping to get this 100% finished this week.

### Day 5: 1/7/2017

**Today's Progress** Aside from a few hours watching the Lions/Seahawks football game, I literally spent the entire rest of my day working primarily on my calculator.

**Thoughts** I basically scrapped my entire JS code from before, and rewrote it using a handful of click event handlers. I still have a good bit to do -- namely cleaning up a few bugs and improving the design -- but the nuts and bolts are finished at least. Pretty happy to have built a functioning calculator. I also uploaded my rough draft to Github.

### Day 4: 1/6/2017

**Today's Progress** I read another chapter of YDKJS and did a few "katas" on Codewars.

**Thoughts** I'm now up to "7 kyu" on Codewars, and I'm also nearly finished with the third book of YDKJS. Tomorrow I plan on devoting most of the day to coding, so I hope to make good progress on my calculator then.

### Day 3: 1/5/2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on my calculator for a bit, then switched over to Codewars for some problem solving.

**Thoughts** After a long work day, I was feeling fried and was struggling to make any real headway on my calculator. I wanted to do at least a full hour of coding, however, so I decided to give Codewars a shot. I had signed up months ago but never really used it. Turns out that was a mistake! I am loving the site. Once I figured out their "kata" system, I dove right in and finished a bunch of their basic-level JavaScript challenges. This turned out to be exactly the boost I needed after feeling hopeless earlier. I will definitely be using this on days when I need a break but still want to code.

### Day 2: 1/4/2017

**Today's Progress** I finished Problem Set 0 for CS50, read another chapter of You Don't Know JavaScript and watched a few videos from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts** CS50's first problem set requires using Scratch to create a game/animation/project. I used to consider Scratch as "kiddy stuff", but after playing with it today I was impressed. It's actually a pretty great introduction to programming. I didn't go out of my way to build anything extra amazing since I would rather put that time into more advanced programming, but I did build a simple little game that meets all of the grading criteria. I'm looking forward to starting next week's material, which will be my introduction into the world of C.

### Day 1: 1/3/2017 (New Year's reboot!)

**Today's Progress** Seeing so many other people commit to the 2017 #100DaysOfCode challenge got me inspired to reboot my quest. I started my coding day by reading a chapter of the third YDKJS book (all about 'this', which I don't completely comprehend) and going over the lecture/notes for CS50's Problem Set 0. For my actual hour of code, I worked on my calculator project. While I made some progress in getting the math operations to work, it's still crazy buggy. The code is also pretty crude thanks to an overreliance on jQuery, but I think I will clean it up (and possibly convert to vanilla JS) once I get everything working. Finally, I cloned this repo so I can get in the habit of manually pushing this to Github everyday.

**Thoughts** I'm glad I started this challenge again, especially since there are hundreds of others doing this at the exact same time. Right now my biggest goals are to finish the Free Code Camp front end certification (three projects + a handful of algorithms are all I have left), work through CS50, and read the You Don't Know JavaScript series.

### Day 32: 11/18/2016

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my secret FCC project.

**Thoughts** I spent most of my evening building a site from the ground up. This felt good since I usually just start with a basic Bootstrap template and go from there. It looks pretty rough, but there's a good foundation in place.

**Sadly, this is where my streak ended. Life got in the way with a very busy weekend, but keeping the streak through the holidays just wasn't going to be feasible anyway since I will be spending several days out of town. At the very least, I am pleased with the progress I made during these 32 days, and this experience has reinvigorated my love of coding.**

### Day 31: 11/17/2016

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my tic-tac-toe game and started a secret project for the FCC forum challenge.

**Thoughts** There was a weekly front end development challenge posted on the Free Code Camp forum that caught my eye, so I started putting something together for that. Not ready to reveal anything yet since I'm not sure I'll have the time to finish by next weekend.

### Day 30: 11/15/2016

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Tic Tac Toe project and got acclimated with Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts** I feel like I'm struggling more with the design aspects of this game than I ever was with the actual coding part. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing, heh. I added a modal box that pops up when you click "new game", that way the user has to select "X" or "O" before starting. I like that presentation rather than the way I had it set up previously. Definitely feeling a little rusty with my CSS though... been focusing on JavaScript and jQuery so much lately.

### Day 29: 11/14/2016

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts** I want to improve my game's UI since it's extremely basic right now. I'm not much of a designer though, so currently struggling with making it look better. Besides experimenting with various styles and presentations, I spent some time looking into cleaning up my GitHub profile. I'm considering merging all of my Learn.co repositories into one general repo. Right now it's a bit of a mess...

### Day 28: 11/13/2016

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts** I didn't have much time today so I was only able to work on cleaning up my overall code a bit. In my testing, I found a couple of bugs in what I thought was unbeatable AI. Still lots to do!

### Day 27: 11/12/2016

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts** Made some awesome progress today! I finally have a working tic tac toe game, complete with notification if you win, lose or draw. I used [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) to develop an optimal strategy, and then hard-coded in every possible scenario. This was a pretty crude way to go about things, but I really just wanted to see if I could get a working game first. In that regard, mission accomplished! This is only the beginning though. I want to clean up the code so not everything is hard-coded (possibly with the Minimax algorithm?), and ideally I would also like to switch from jQuery to vanilla JS. I made a Trello board to keep me on task. I'm pretty excited to have a working game, one that I didn't build by following along with a tutorial (like the Learn.co project). Now I have a great starting point and something to build on for my next handful of days.

### Day 26: 11/11/2016

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts** So I lost my daily streak on Wednesday. I needed a recovery day after the election fallout, and then missed out on Thursday as well. Was back at it today though, and I feel I made a lot of good progress on my FCC project. My code is still a bit of a mess since I'm trying to translate some of my Ruby logic to JavaScript, but I was able to at least get a solid visual representation of the tic tac toe board. Feeling optimistic.

### Day 25: 11/8/2016

**Today's Progress**: Time was limited so I went back to Udacity's Object Oriented JS course.

**Thoughts** I finished the Closures section -- very confusing at first, but I feel I have a better understanding of the subject matter now. I actually planned on working on my Tic Tac Toe project some more, but for some reason my Dropbox folder didn't sync up to my laptop so I didn't have access. Really kicking myself for not pushing it to Github yesterday!

### Day 24: 11/7/2016

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts** Translating my CLI Ruby version to browser-based JavaScript isn't going to be easy, but at least I have a much better idea of how to get things going. I'm feeling cautiously optimistic.

### Day 23: 11/6/2016

**Today's Progress**: I started working on my Tic Tac Toe project for Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** I wasn't wanting to do an algorithm challenge today, so I decided to start a new FCC project. Since I had just built a Ruby version of Tic Tac Toe recently, it made a lot of sense to begin transitioning this to JavaScript. Today I built out the basic structure with HTML and CSS and began brainstorming how I want to implement my JS logic.

### Day 22: 11/5/2016

**Today's Progress**: I finished up Udacity's JavaScript Basics course, started their Object-Oriented JavaScript course, and began the early stages of trying to solve the next Free Code Camp advanced algorithm ("No Repeats Please").

**Thoughts** Today was rough. While I finished up the Basics course, I didn't build the final project since it wasn't something I was especially interested in (an "interactive" resume). I would rather just finish reworking my portfolio page. I took a look at Free Code Camp's next algorithm challenge, and it looks brutal. I have a vague idea of how to tackle it, but it seems there will be a ton of working parts and I'm not even sure where to begin. That's what pushed me back to Udacity to see if their Object-Oriented class could help me grasp it better. At this point in the past, I would normally take a break for a couple days, but there's no way I want to lose this streak. Plain and simple, JavaScript is hard, and the only way to learn is to persevere. I'll be back at it tomorrow.

### Day 21: 11/4/2016

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on Udacity's JavaScript Basics course.

**Thoughts** Again limited on time today (thanks to an epic Cubs parade). Worked through more of Udacity, nearly done with the course. Tomorrow will be a long coding day.

### Day 20: 11/3/2016

### Day 19: 11/2/2016

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on Udacity's JavaScript Basics course.

**Thoughts** With Game 7 of the World Series happening, I again found myself with little time to code. Because of this, I did some more work on Udacity.

### Day 18: 11/1/2016

**Today's Progress**: I started working on Udacity's JavaScript Basics course.

**Thoughts** Time was at a premium today so I decided to do some work on Udacity. I'm pleasantly surprised at the learning progression in this course -- it kind of throws you right in and expects you to do a ton of internet searching/reading on your own. I can dig that, especially since I don't need a course to hold my hand at this point.

### Day 17: 10/31/2016

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Inventory Update advanced algorithm on FCC.

**Thoughts** I had a hard time figuring out how to sort a 2D array, and I ended up using more outside help than I wanted to get it to work. I am starting to feel more comfortable using array methods like .reduce and .map, however, so that feels good.

### Day 16: 10/30/2016

**Today's Progress**: I started working on Free Code Camp's Inventory Update advanced algorithm. I also spent some time on Udacity's JavaScript Basics course.

**Thoughts** I kind of miss Learn.co's learning platform and would love to continue down their path, but there's no way I can afford $13k to do so. So back to Free Code Camp and Udacity, both of which offer tremendous free learning experiences. I have been putting off the advanced algorithm challenges for too long -- it's time to knock these out!

### Day 15: 10/29/2016

**Today's Progress**: I finished Learn.co's Ruby track.

**Thoughts** I was able to spend most of my day coding, so I finished building the Tic Tac Toe CLI game twice -- once procedurally and then again using object-oriented programming. Aside from a couple of hangups in the transition to OOP, the process went smoothly, and I feel I learned quite a bit doing this. Now I have a good precursor I can use for when I start Free Code Camp's Tic Tac Toe project using JavaScript.

### Day 10: 10/24/2016

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on Learn.co's Ruby track and also finished the final JavaScript project.

**Thoughts** I spent longer than necessary on the final JavaScript project -- a Rock Dodger game -- due to a bug on Learn.co's side. I was able to get help from an instructor, however, who acknowledged the bug and advised me to just comment out that test. I did the bare minimum to get this to pass, but I am excited to do more work on the game and customize it as I see fit. I'm pretty happy that I was able to build a working game, even if it is rudimentary at the moment.

### Day 9: 10/23/2016

**Today's Progress**: I finished a section of Learn.co's Ruby track.

**Thoughts** Did not have as much time today either, so I continued working on the early Ruby stuff. I have only played around with the language a little bit before, but so far Ruby doesn't seem far removed from JavaScript.

### Day 8: 10/22/2016

**Today's Progress**: I started Learn.co's Ruby Fundamentals track.

**Thoughts** I wasn't able to do more than the hour minimum today, so I opted to wait on the final JavaScript project until I could sit down and finish it in one go. Since I am really enjoying Learn.co's course setup, I decided to check out their Ruby track.

### Day 7: 10/21/2016

**Today's Progress**: I finished Free Code Camp's "Exact Change" advanced algorithm challenge, and Learn.co's jQuery section.

**Thoughts** Both GitHub and Learn.co were down for most of the day, so I decided to go back to Free Code Camp to finally work on an advanced algorithm challenge I had been avoiding. While I finished it, I needed a lot of help. I was able to get half of the tests to pass fairly easily, but it was a real struggle to get the exact change from the drawer. On the plus side, I did learn a lot about the .reduce() method (funfunfunction's YouTube videos were a great help there). Once I finished this algorithm, Learn.co was finally back online, so I completed their jQuery section before calling it a night.

### Day 5: 10/19/2016

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Loops section and half of the DOM section in Learn.co's prepwork. Currently 77% complete overall.

**Thoughts** My biggest takeaway from this batch of coursework was the concept of callbacks, something I am admittedly not well-versed in. I thought the course's writing and subsequent labs did a good job covering how this works, especially when using the Array.forEach method.

### Day 4: 10/18/2016

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Data Structures section in Learn.co's prepwork.

**Thoughts** I thought I could knock out the last two labs in this section pretty quick, but it ended up taking me a few hours to do so. The difficulty has definitely ramped up, and it's clear I need to familiarize myself with objects more. Still, I'm happy to have finished and looking forward to the next challenge tomorrow.

### Day 3: 10/17/2016

**Today's Progress**: I finished a few more labs in the Learn.co JavaScript track. Just two more to go in the Data Structures section.

**Thoughts** I got my hands dirty with objects and their properties, then spent some time playing with loops. Wanted to finish this section tonight but it was taking longer than expected.

### Day 2: 10/16/2016

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Array labs on Learn.co's Introduction to JavaScript track.

**Thoughts** I didn't have as much time to code as I had hoped, so I was only able to do one hour. I finished the labs on arrays, and it helped reinforce how the slice and splice methods work, among others.

### Day 1: 10/15/2016

**Today's Progress**: I finished the "Functions & Scope" section on Learn.co's Introduction to JavaScript track.

**Thoughts** I've been bouncing around a bit in my projects but decided to just go ahead and finish the Learn.co track that I started a couple weeks ago. Even though I do not plan to enroll in their paid bootcamp, I have been really enjoying their free course. It's the first course I've found that uses both the command line and Git to submit work, which is a major plus in my book. My major takeaways from today's lessons were the importance of scope when using variables, and also how hoisting works.

### Day 0: 10/10/2016 - 10/14/2016

While I am marking October 15 as Day 1 of this project, I have actually been coding for several days in a row now. I spent some time doing coursework on Udacity, particularly their Intro to Web Development course. I decided to pause that since it started going into Python. I feel like I need to improve my JavaScript skills before I start learning a new language.
